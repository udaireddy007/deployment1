1) Instance within your VPC install NGINX (sudo yum install nginx httpd-tools-y) and add the following sample configuraion:

2) vim /etc/nginx/conf.d/nginx_keep_alive.conf

events {
    worker_connections 1024;
}

http {

  upstream elasticsearch {
    server 127.0.0.1:80;
   
    keepalive 15;
 }
 
 server {
   listen 80;

   location / {
     proxy_pass <vpc_endpoint found in ES cluster, keep only http);
     proxy_http_version 1.1;
     proxy_set_header Connection "Keep-Alive";
     proxy_set_header Proxy-Connection "Keep-Alive";
   }

 }

}

3) sudo nginx -p $PWD/nginx/ -c $PWD/nginx_keep_alive.conf

4) now that the nginx proxy is up and running, you can now able to connect to Kibana endpoint by using the public IP of your EC2 proxy instance, for example: http://X.X.X.X/_plugin/kibana

(make sure edit the SG rules to your IP)

Troubleshooting:
1) the instance should reach the ES.
2) telnet <vpc endpoint> 443
3) curl -XGET <vpc endpoint>
4) add SG rule for ES SG to EC2 instance SG
